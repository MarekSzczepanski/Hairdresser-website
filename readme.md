# Hairdresser website  
##### This website has been made for training purposes 

#### Introduction
I had to make a website to train my front-end skills. Choosing a hairdresser theme was a random choice. Salon mentioned on this website doesn't exist. This project has not been influenced by any tutorial, the code was created from scratch, exclusively by me.
